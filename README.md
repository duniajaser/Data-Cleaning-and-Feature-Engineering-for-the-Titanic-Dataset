# Data-Cleaning-and-Feature-Engineering-for-the-Titanic-Dataset
This repository hosts the code and documentation for the "Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering for the Titanic Dataset" project, undertaken as part of the ENCS5141â€”Intelligent Systems Laboratory course at Birzeit University. The project focuses on preprocessing the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning analysis.

## Project Overview

The project explores essential data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, outliers, encoding categorical variables, feature selection, and scaling. The goal is to enhance the dataset's suitability for training machine learning models, specifically using Random Forest classifiers.
